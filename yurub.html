    <h2>Lyrics</h2>
    <pre>
        O God of all creation,

        Bless this, our land and nation.
        
        Justice be our shield and defender,
        
        May we dwell in unity,
        
        Peace and liberty.
        
        Plenty be found within our borders.
        
        Let one and all arise
        
        With hearts both strong and true.
        
        Service be our earnest endeavor,
        
        And our Homeland of Kenya,
        
        Heritage of splendor,
        
        Firm may we stand to defend.
        
        Let all with one accord
        
        In common bond united,
        
        Build this our nation together,
        
        And the glory of Kenya,
        
        The fruit of our labor
        
        Fill every heart with thanksgiving.  
    </pre>
  </body>
